Dear Vitalik

I am currently organising the Blockchain Expo on the 29th and 30th November in Santa Clara - http://blockchain-expo.com/northamerica and would be delighted to invite you as a speaker for the event.

Last month in London we had over 5,000 visitors and unprecedented feedback and interest in this theme and the work you are doing is really interesting and i think it would be great addition to the conference programme.

This is the session i have in mind:
29 November - 16.40pm - Closing keynote: Ethereum and the cryptoeconomics
Proof of work and hashes
Where and how blockchain-based systems can go wrong
Censorship resistance and scalable validation

The show is aiming to attract 1500 people, on top of the 5000 people that attend the IOT Tech expo, which is a co-located event, We were quite interested in the role blockchain might play within IoT services, hence the co-location. 
Itâ€™s a free to attend event and we are building a strong and insightful line up of speakers on this theme.

I hope you are able to join us for the conference in November and look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards
Rita
